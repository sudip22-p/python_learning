# ‚úÖ Exception Handling in Python
# Used to gracefully handle runtime errors without crashing the program

try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 100 / num  # May raise ZeroDivisionError
    print("‚úÖ Result:", result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("‚ùå You can't divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("‚ùå Please enter a valid number!")

    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    print("üîö This runs no matter what (cleanup, closing files, etc.)")


# ‚úÖ Custom Exception Example
# You can define your own error types using class and raise

üí° Real-World Example:
- try-except = like wearing a helmet when riding a bike: prevents damage on error.
- finally = like putting your bike in the garage after riding, no matter what happened.
- custom error = like raising your own alert if someone breaks your house rules.
